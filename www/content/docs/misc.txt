DataMapper comes loaded features, many of which other ORMs must external libraries for.

h2. Single Table Inheritance

Many ORMs support Single Table Inheritance and DataMapper is no different.  In order to declare a model for Single Table Inheritance, define a property with the data-type of @:class@

<notextile>
<coderay lang="ruby" line_numbers="inline">
class Person < DataMapper::Base
  property :name, :string
  property :job, :string, :length => 255
  property :type, :class
  ...
end
  
class Geek < Person; end
class Nerd < Person; end
</coderay>
</notextile>

When DataMapper sees your @type@ column declared as type @:class@, it will automatically insert the class name of the object you've created and later instantiate that row as that class.

h2. Paranoia

Sometimes...most times...you don't _really_ want to destroy a row in the database, you just want to mark it as deleted so that you can restore it later if need be.  This is aptly-named Paranoia and DataMapper has basic support for this baked right in.  When you declare a @deleted_at@ or @deleted_on@ property, DataMapper will pick up on it and assume they are for storing when an object was deleted.  

Once these columns exist, DataMapper will also tack on @deleted_at IS NULL@ to generated queries in order to avoid retrieving rows marked as deleted.

To subvert paranoia and pull back previously deleted rows, simply use manual querying:

<notextile>
  <coderay lang="ruby">
    dead_people = database.query('SELECT id, name, job FROM people WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL')
  </coderay>
</notextile>

For now, you'll get back Structs which will "quack like" a Person object, but won't have any of the decorations you defined in the Person class.  This is plenty to resurrect the row from it's deleted-ness.

<notextile>
<coderay lang="ruby" line_numbers="inline">
dead_people.map do |zombie|
  Person.new(zombie.attributes.reject{ |k, v| k == :deleted_at} )
end   # dead_people will no longer contain zombies, but real live people
</coderay>
</notextile>



h2. Multiple Database Connections

DataMapper sports a concept called a Context which encapsulates the database context in which you want operations to occur.  For example, when you setup a database connection in "getting_started":/getting_started.html, you were defining a context known as @:default@

<notextile>
<coderay lang="ruby" line_numbers="inline">
DataMapper::Database.setup({  # :default is the default context name
  :adapter  => 'mysql',
  :host     => 'localhost',
  :username => 'root',
  :password => 'R00tPaswooooord',
  :database => 'myspiffyblog_development'
})
</coderay>
</notextile>

But if you supply a context name, you will now have 2 database contexts with their own unique loggers, connection pool, identity map....one default context and one named context

<notextile>
<coderay lang="ruby" line_numbers="inline">
DataMapper::Database.setup(:external, {  # :external is the context name
  :adapter  => 'mysql',
  :host     => 'otherhose',
  :username => 'root',
  :password => 'R00tPaswooooord2',
  :database => 'someother_development'
})
</coderay>
</notextile>

To use one context rather than another, simply wrap your code block inside a @database@ call. It will return whatever your block of code returns.

<notextile>
<coderay lang="ruby" line_numbers="inline">
  database(:external) { Person.first }
</coderay>
</notextile>

This will use your connection to the @:external@ database and retrieve people from there.

h2. Chained Associations
