* Bug Reports

h2. Code Style Guidelines

When contributing any code to DataMapper, please follow these guidelines.

# Spec first. Spec thoroughly. (DataMapper is written with "Rspec":http://rspec.info/)
# Parentheses around parameter lists for methods
# Two space indent - not tabs!
# Documentation is required

h2. Submissions

When you've got an itch to scratch, jump in and contribute!  Write a few specs showing us how your code works, create a patch and "submit it":http://wm.lighthouseapp.com/projects/4819-datamapper/overview as a new ticket or a fix for an existing one.  After a few patches and many thanks, you'll get commit access.  Also remember that we benchmark all but the most trivial of patches, because we care about performance and you should too!
