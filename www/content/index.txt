DataMapper is a "Object Relational Mapper":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping written in "Ruby.":http://ruby-lang.org/ The goal is to create an ORM which is fast, thread-safe and feature rich.

To learn a little more about this project and why you should be interested, read the "Why Datamapper?":/why.html page.

h2(newRelease). 0.3.0 is out!

p(newRelease). 0.3.0 is a maintenance release, bringing minor bug-fixes and minimal new features to DataMapper 0.2.5. This is the latest stable gem using database terminology and metaphors.


h2(newRelease). The Great Refactoring

p(newRelease). "Tip" DataMapper (hosted on "github":http://github.com/sam/dm-core) is going through a dramatic re-factor.  The public API is being uncoupled from database-specific terminology and will soon support other persistence layers like XML and RESTful web-services.  "Tip" is not stable by any stretch of the imagination and should only be used for experimental purposes. Watch "github commit messages":http://github.com/sam/dm-core/commits/master for updates.

h1. Examples using 0.3.0
