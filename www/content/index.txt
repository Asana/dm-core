h2(newRelease). The Great Refactoring

p(newRelease). Edge DataMapper (hosted on "github":http://github.com/sam/dm-core) is going through a rather dramatic refactor.  If your riding Edge, consider hopping off and freezing on the SVN HEAD until the new public api is stable.

h1. Examples

<notextile>
<coderay lang="ruby" line_numbers="inline">
class Animal < DataMapper::Base
  property :name, :string
  property :notes, :text, :lazy => true
  
  has_one :favourite_fruit, :class => 'Fruit'
  has_and_belongs_to_many :exhibits
end
</coderay>
</notextile>

<notextile>
<coderay lang="ruby" line_numbers="inline">
monkey = Animal.first(:name => 'Monkey')
monkey.favourite_fruit.name # => 'Bananas'
</coderay>
</notextile>
