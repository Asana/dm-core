Since DM is going through a Great Refactoring, the website may need to change a little to reflect the new stuff

New site structure'll probably look something like this:

    .
    |-- community.txt
    |-- development
    |   |-- index.txt
    |   |-- plans.txt
    |   |-- contributing.txt
    |   |-- using_git.rhtml
    |   `-- docs
    |       |-- associations.txt
    |       |-- callbacks.txt
    |       |-- create_and_destroy.txt
    |       |-- find.txt
    |       |-- index.txt
    |       |-- install.txt
    |       `-- properties.txt
    |-- css/
    |-- js/
    |-- getting_started.txt
    |-- images/
    |-- index.txt
    `-- why.txt
